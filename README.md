# snake-water-gun-game
This is a very basic game developed by me in my 2nd semester of my engineering. While leaning conditional statements very first time in programming and developing this game it's a good  experience . This is not a big game or something special but in my starting face of learning about programming it's actually a very interesting game for me.
